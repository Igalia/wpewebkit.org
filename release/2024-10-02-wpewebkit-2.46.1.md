This is the first bug fix release in the stable 2.46 series.

### What's new in WPE WebKit 2.46.1?

- Use the Skia CPU renderer by default, which at the moment performs better
  in a number of embedded devices. The GPU renderer is still available and
  may be enabled by setting `WEBKIT_SKIA_ENABLE_CPU_RENDERING=0` in the
  environment.
- Add an `ENABLE_WPE_PLATFORM` build option to CMake. This is disabled by
  default because the WPEPlatform API is in development and provided as
  part of the 2.46.x releases as a preview feature.
- Fix login QR code not shown in WhatsApp web.
- Fix processes not spawning when process startup is customized using
  the `wpe_process_provider` API from `libwpe`.
- Fix mouse simulation with WebDriver when using a classic WPE backend
  through `libwpe`.
- Disable DMABuf video sink by default to prevent file descriptor leaks.
- Fix building the MiniBrowser.
- Fix the build with `libsysprof-capture` version 44 and older.
- Fix the build with GCC 13.
- Fix several crashes and rendering issues.
