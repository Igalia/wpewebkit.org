This is the first development release leading towards the 1.14 series.

### What's new in libwpe 1.13.1?

- New API to provide input events to be treated by WebKit as gamepad inputs.
- New `WPE_ENABLE_XKB` build option, enabled by default, which can be used
  to completely avoid usage of `libxkbcommon`.
- Allow libwpe to be built as a static library. The rest of the code
  linked with the static library must provide the `_wpe_loader_interface`
  symbol, as `dlopen()` will not be used.
- Allow building libwpe within a larger CMake project.
- Update the required Meson version to 0.55.0
