  at build time), Git repository information.
- The libcogcore library now has proper libtool versioning.
- fdo: Fix axis scrolling.
- New "experimental-drm" platform plug-in which uses KMS+DRM (Kernel Mode
  Setting, Direct Rendering Manager) for direct display on framebuffers,
  and libinput for input event processing.
