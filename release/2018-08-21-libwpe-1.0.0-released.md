This release changes the API version to 0.2, and introduces the following
changes and features:

### What's new in the libwpe 1.0.0 release?

- The library is now called `libwpe` to avoid confusion. The `WPEBackend` name
  used previously seemed to indicate that the library implemented a WPE
  backend. The new `libwpe` name better reflects that it contains code needed
  by the WPE WebKit port ([#27](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/issues/27)).

- The `libwpe` library now uses the [libtool
  versioning](https://autotools.io/libtool/version.html) convention
  ([#21](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/issues/21)).

- Handle conversion of keysyms to Unicode inside `libwpe`. This allowed to
  remove the `unicode` member from keyboard event structs, and removing
  `wpe_input_key_mapper`/`wpe_input_key_mapper_interface`
  ([#23](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/pull/23)).

- New field in event structs to specify keyboard modifiers
  ([#22](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/pull/22)).

- New API for keymap and composition handling based on `libxkbcommon`
  ([#24](https://github.com/WebPlatformForEmbedded/libwpe/pull/24)).
