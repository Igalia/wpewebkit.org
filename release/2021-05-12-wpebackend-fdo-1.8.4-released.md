This is a bug fix release in the stable 1.8 series.

### What's new in WPEBackend-fdo 1.8.4?

- Fixed frozen web views not being updated after PSON when multiple web
  views (and hence view backends) are in use.
- Fixed invalid usage of Wayland client connections in the nested compositor
  which caused crashes in some situations.
