This is the first development release leading towards the 2.50 series.

### What's new in WPE WebKit 2.49.1?

- Change threaded rendering implementation to use Skia API instead of WebCore display
  lists that are not thread safe. This also allowed to improve performance by recording
  layers once and replaying every dirty region in different worker threads.
- Added hybrid rendering mode that tries to use the GPU worker threads, but if they
  are all busy the CPU worker threads are used if possible.
- Add volume locking support to media player.
- Add support for tracing counters with Sysprof.
- Add a default accessibility implementation using ATK to WPEPlatform.
- Add new API in WPEPlatform that allows attaching user data to `WPEEvent`.
- Add new API in WPEPlatform to get/set the input purpose and hints for
  the current input through `WPEInputMethodContext`.
- Fix several crashes and rendering issues.
