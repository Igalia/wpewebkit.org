This is the first development release leading towards the 1.8 series.

### What's new in libwpe 1.7.1?

- New build configuration system based on Meson. The existing CMake-based
  system is still maintained, and both produce the same outputs.
- Hidden visibility is now used by default for symbols, and only those
  belonging to the public API are exported.
