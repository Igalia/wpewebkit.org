This is the first bug fix release in the stable 1.6 series.

### What's new in WPEBackend-fdo 1.6.1?

- Fixed build when using EGL stacks with odd `EGLNativeDisplay` definitions.
- Fixed version retrieval functions not being exposed as public symbols.
- Improve build configuration by instructing CMake to report mismatched
  versions of dependency libraries, instead of failing to compile.
