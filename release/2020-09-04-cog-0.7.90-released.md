### What's new in Cog 0.7.90?

- cog: Added the `--ignore-tls-errors` command line option which allows
  ignoring TLS certificate validation errors.
- cog: Fixed navigation in some sites by following URI passed to
  `window.open()` loading them in the active view.
- fdo: Improve the logic to set the opaque region of the Wayland surface if it
  could have changed between exported frames, which saves some CPU time.
- drm: Support choosing the video mode to use using the
  `COG_PLATFORM_DRM_VIDEO_MODE` environment variable.
