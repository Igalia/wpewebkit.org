This is the first stable release in the 1.8 series.

### Highlights of the libwpe 1.8.0 release

- New build configuration system based on [Meson](http://mesonbuild.com/). The
  existing system based on CMake is still available and both produce the same
  outputs.
- Hidden visibility is now used by default for symbols, and only those
  belonging to the public API are exported.
