### Highlights of the Cog 0.6.0 release

The FDO platform plug-in has received a number of improvements:

- Added support for input methods.
- Added support for smooth scrolling using 2D axis events.
- Added support for direct-display video rendering.
- A default pointer cursor is now set if the `wayland-cursor` library is
  available at build time.

Starting with this release the DRM platform plug-in is no longer considered
experimental.
