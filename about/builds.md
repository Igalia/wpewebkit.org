While there are several [simple ways for developers to experiment with and explore WPE](/about/exploring.html), none are tuned for performance. Generally, shipping products for embedded systems are performance-tuned custom builds.  To make this easier, there is also [meta-webkit](https://github.com/Igalia/meta-webkit), which provides build recipes, WebKit based runtimes, and browsers for use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.

We also have some [performance tips](https://github.com/Igalia/meta-webkit/wiki/PerformanceTips) that might be helpful.
