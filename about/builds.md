While there are several [simple ways for developers to experiment with and explore WPE]({{'/about/exploring.html' | url}}), none are tuned for performance. Generally, shipping products for embedded systems are performance-tuned custom builds.

We also have some [performance tips](https://github.com/Igalia/meta-webkit/wiki/PerformanceTips) that might be helpful.
