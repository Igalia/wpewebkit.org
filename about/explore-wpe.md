# Get Started with WPEwebkit

</header>

## Grab the code

If you're an experienced embedded engineer, you'll most likely want to grab the [code](/release) and build and tune WPE for your specific needs.
 

## Easy pre-builts

We've also tried to make it easy for developers who aren't comfortable building entire embedded systems to get their hands on _something_ where they can begin exploring and learning useful things. Our easy prebuilts do just that - they won't be well optimized in the way a final product usually is, but they're nonetheless very useful.

If you find any problem or want to know more about optimizing WPE for your hardware or use cases, please [contact us](/code).

### __Install it from your GNU/Linux OS distribution__

These packages are not just a quick and simple way to test WPE but they also come with all the development files and documentation necessary to build and test software that uses this web engine.  WPE WebKit is available in several Linux distributions including:

  * [Debian](https://packages.debian.org/search?searchon=sourcenames&keywords=wpewebkit)
  * [Ubuntu](https://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=wpewebkit&searchon=sourcenames&suite=all&section=all)
  * [Raspbian](https://archive.raspbian.org/raspbian/pool/main/w/wpewebkit/)
  * [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/wpewebkit/)
  * [Fedora](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/philn/wpewebkit/)
