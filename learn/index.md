# Learn & Discover

Wondering ifâ€¦

* [WPE is available for your device?](/about/supported-hardware.html)
* What is an embedded browser? (The first half of https://wpewebkit.org/about/exploring.html)
* Easy ways to explore WPE (The second half of the same page, but improved)

Possibly a resources section that links to things of interest which live elsewhere

Might also be a good place for videos?

Perhaps the basic architecture (maybe improved) diagram is also useful here
