                I'm a proud Igalian since 2019 and have been working on WebKit since the early days in the year 2000, when WebKit did not exist yet, and kjs/khtml/ksvg were still young projects
                under heavy development. Since that time, efficient painting / layout / etc. with a main focus on SVG is my main area of interest.
