## [WPE Builds]({{ '/about/builds.html' | url }})

While there are several simple ways for developers to experiment with and explore WPE, none are tuned for performance. Generally, shipping products for embedded systems are performance-tuned custom builds. To make this easier, there is also meta-webkit, which provides build recipes, WebKit based runtimes, and browsers for use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.

## [Release Schedule]({{ '/release/schedule' | url }})

WPE WebKit follows a **6-month development cycle**:

<ul class="arrows">
<li>There are two feature releases every year, typically in March and September.</li>
<li>Within feature releases, there may be any number of bug-fixes.</li>
<li>Development releases are the base for the feature releases that follow them.  They do not follow a fixed schedule in the release cycle.</li>
</ul>

WPE WebKit and [WebKitGTK](https://webkitgtk.org/) share a fair amount of code.  Therefore, both projects produce their feature releases simultaneously, and share the same release branches.  For bug-fix releases, the release teams for both projects try to sync their version numbers as well as they can.

<p>WPE is the official WebKit port for embedded platforms. WPE is uniquely designed for embedded systems in that it doesn’t depend on any user-interface toolkits such as the traditional Cocoa, GTK, etc toolkits.</p>
