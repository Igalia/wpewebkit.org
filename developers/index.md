# Developers

## [WPE Design](https://wpewebkit.org/about/architecture.html)

## Easy prebuilts

* Linux distros for debian, ubuntu, raspbian, arch linux
* [Install WPE and minibrowser with flatpak](https://wpewebkit.org/about/flatpak.html)
* Raspberry Pi OS images
* [Install with Balena](https://wpewebkit.org/about/balena-wpe.html)

## Build and tune 

While there are several simple ways for developers to experiment with and explore WPE, none are tuned for performance. Generally, shipping products for embedded systems are performance-tuned custom builds. To make this easier, there is also meta-webkit, which provides build recipes, WebKit based runtimes, and browsers for use with OpenEmbedded and/or Yocto.
