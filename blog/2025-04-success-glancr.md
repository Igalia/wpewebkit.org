From SmartTVs to light bulbs and cameras, smart devices are not hard to find in homes these days. [Glancr](https://glancr.net)'s smart mirror is a device that seamlessly integrates digital functionality into everyday life. Powered by its custom operating system [mirr.OS](https://gitlab.com/glancr/mirr-os), Glancr puts the Web at the forefront, allowing users to see all the information that matters to them in a customizable interface, right on a mirror. Besides being useful in smart home scenarios, Glancr can also expand the possibilities in other use cases in the industry, such as digital signage, point-of-sale devices, or even the healthcare industry.

WPE WebKit empowers mirr.OS to efficiently run and render interactive widgets and applications, ensuring a fluid and responsive user experience at the same time that enables mirr.OS to leverage the power of the Web Platform. This allows developers to create rich, web-based interfaces tailored to the smart mirror's unique requirements, in order to deliver a seamless and visually compelling interaction layer for users at the same time it bridges the gap between digital functionality and aesthetic appeal.
