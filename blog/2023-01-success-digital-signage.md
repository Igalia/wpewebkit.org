Digital signage web rendering players have many advantages and are a trend nowadays. They allow to use HTML5 for composing the UI, provisioning and scheduling new contents to the screens from the cloud is simple and effortless, they provide a robust environment with an automatic crash recovery system, etc. They are also a great choice for digital signage kiosk deployments.

WPE WebKit is an excellent option to use as web rendering engine for Linux-based digital signage players, specially for the low-end market, where WPE Webkit allows to achieve great graphics and rendering performance in the less powerful devices like the ones based on the Raspberry Pi. As a result, WPE WebKit is naturally compatible with the hardware of the main digital signage manufactures that rely on these kind of lower-powered devices.
