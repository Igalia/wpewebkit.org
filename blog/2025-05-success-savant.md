Igalia worked with Savant Systems to bring a seamless, high-performance music experience to its smart home ecosystem. By enhancing WPE WebKit with critical backported patches, developing a custom Widevine CDM, and engineering a JavaScript D-Bus bridge, WPE WebKit was adapted to ensure robust and secure media playback directly within Savant’s platform.

Delivering a tightly integrated music experience in a smart home environment required overcoming significant technical challenges. To achieve this, WPE WebKit’s capabilities were streamlined to enable a fluid interface and reliable communication between the browser and the music process that powers a third-party music integration.

With deep expertise in browser technology and embedded systems, Igalia was able to help Savant implement a tailored WPE WebKit integration, optimizing performance while maintaining security and responsiveness. The result is a cutting-edge solution that enhances user experience and supports Savant’s commitment to innovation in smart home entertainment.
