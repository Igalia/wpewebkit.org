* <a name="CVE-2021-42762" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42762">CVE-2021-42762</a>
  * Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1.
  * Credit to an anonymous reporter.
  * BubblewrapLauncher.cpp allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows a
    sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the
    sandboxed process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS
    syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace. The impact is
    limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKit mounts
    inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise
    confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.


We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
