* <a name="CVE-2022-2294" href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-2294">CVE-2022-2294</a>
  * Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.36.5 if
    USE_LIBWEBRTC is enabled.

  * Heap buffer overflow in LibWebRTC allowed a remote attacker to
    potentially exploit heap corruption via a crafted HTML page. NOTE:
    The tarballs of WebKitGTK or WPE WebKit don't ship LibWebRTC. Also
    the LibWebRTC support is disabled by default. You only are affected
    by this vulnerability if your build enabled the USE_LIBWEBRTC CMake
    option and used the repository as source instead of the tarballs.


We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
