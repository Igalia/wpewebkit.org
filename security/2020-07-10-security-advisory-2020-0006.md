  * The bubblewrap sandbox of WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit, prior to 2.28.3,
    failed to properly block access to CLONE_NEWUSER and the TIOCSTI
    ioctl. CLONE_NEWUSER could potentially be used to confuse xdg-
    desktop-portal, which allows access outside the sandbox. TIOCSTI can
    be used to directly execute commands outside the sandbox by writing
    to the controlling terminal's input buffer, similar to
    CVE-2017-5226.


We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
