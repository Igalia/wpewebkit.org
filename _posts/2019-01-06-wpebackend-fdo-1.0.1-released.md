This is a bugfix release in the stable 1.0 series.

### What's new in the WPEBackend-fdo 1.0.1 release?

- Allow `wpe_fdo_initialize_for_egl_display()` to be called multiple times;
  it will emit a warning when trying to switch to a different EGL display,
  which is unsupported ([#26](https://github.com/Igalia/WPEBackend-fdo/pull/26)).
