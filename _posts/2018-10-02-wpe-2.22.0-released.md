This is the first stable release in the 2.22 series.

### What's new in the WPE WebKit 2.22.0 release?

- Several fixes for video playback with media source extensions (MSE).
  This allows using WebM support for YouTube, which no longer works through
  regular video source. Note that MSE is still disabled by default and
  `webkit_settings_set_enable_mediasource()` has to be used to enable the
  feature.
- Add `warn_unused_result` attribute to some JavaScriptCore GLib APIs.
- Fix the build in several platforms: s390x, ppc64le, armv7hl, mips64.
- Fix the build with video disabled.
- Fix symbols with `jsc_` prefix not being exported.
- Fix a memory leak during media playback when using `playbin3`.
- Fix several crashes and rendering issues.

Thanks to all the contributors who made possible this release, they
are far too many to list!
