This is a development release leading towards the 1.14 series.

### What's new in libwpe 1.13.3?

- Modify the gamepad API to pass the `wpe_gamepad_provider` when creating
  new gamepad instances, and the associated `wpe_gamepad_provider_get_backend()`
  accessor.
- Restrict the range of values allowed for the device scaling factor, which
  prevents both divisions by zero and impossibly big graphics buffers.
- Fix pasteboard to use the generic interface by default.
- Fix memory allocation to always abort execution on failure.
