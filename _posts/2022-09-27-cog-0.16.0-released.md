This is the first stable release in the 0.16 series.

### Highlights of the Cog 0.16.0 Release

General:

- Add support for gamepads, using [libmanette](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libmanette)
  for hardware access.
- Switch the build system from CMake to Meson.

Launcher (`cog`):

- New `--gamepad=` command line option to choose the gamepad
  implementation to use.
- New `--proxy=` and `--ignore-host=` command line options, which
  allow setting up a network proxy and a list of hosts that would
  bypass it.
