This is a development release leading towards the 0.14 series.

### What's new in Cog 0.13.90?

- cmake: Enable libsoup3 usage by default, `USE_SOUP2=ON` can still be specified to build against libsoup2.
- cmake: Require version 3.12, which is the same minimum as needed by WebKit.
- cmake: Link the same `wpebackend-fdo` library in all components to avoid crashes due to multiple copies loaded with different behaviours.
- cmake: Fix generated `.pc` file when using an absolute directory for the `CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR` option instead of a relative one.
- core: Add “Try again” button to default error pages.
- gtk4: Fix rendering with drivers that support OpenGL 4.
- wl: Avoid crashing due to missing callbacks by explicitly binding to supported versions of Wayland protocols.
- wl: Fix the build with `COG_WESTON_DIRECT_DISPLAY` enabled.
- wl: Fix fullscreen surface dimensions when using SHM buffers.
- wl: Add keybindings to refresh the current page (<key>Ctrl-R</key>, <key>F5</key>).
- x11: Fix underlinking when the `--as-needed` linker flag is in use.
- x11: Fix rendering in non-composited (traditional) window managers.
- drm, gtk4, x11: Factor out and reuse the GLES textured quad painting code.
- drm, wl, x11: Add refresh rate reporting to let WebKit pace rendering to match the output device.
