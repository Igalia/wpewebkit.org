### What's new in Cog 0.7.90?

- cog: Added the --ignore-tls-errors command line option which allows ignoring
  TLS certificate validation errors.
- cog: Fixed navigation in some sites by following URI passed to window.open()
  loading them in the active view.
- fdo: Improve the logic to set the opaque region of the Wayland surface if it
  could have changed between exported frames, which saves some CPU time.
